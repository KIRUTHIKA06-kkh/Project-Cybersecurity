Microsoft -Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents.

This project aims to enhance the efficiency of Security Operation Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents.
Using the comprehensive GUIDE dataset, the model categorizes incidents as true positive (TP), benign positive (BP), or false positive (FP) based on historical evidence and customer responses. 
The ultimate goal is to support guided response systems in providing SOC analysts with precise, context-rich recommendations, thereby improving the overall security posture of enterprise environments.

Skills required : Dataclaening, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, EDA for Machine Learning Classification Techniques. 
       Model Evaluation Metrics (Macro-F1 Score, Precision, Recall) Cybersecurity Concepts and Frameworks Handling Imbalanced Datasets Model Benchmarking and Optimization.
